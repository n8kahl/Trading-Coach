"""Placeholder for backtesting functionality.

This module defines a `backtest` function that you can expand to evaluate
historical performance of the strategies defined in the library.  A robust
backtester would loop through historical bars, generate signals using
`scanner.evaluate_strategy`, simulate fills on the option contracts using
`contract_selector`, and record statistics such as win rate, average win,
average loss and expectancy.  It would also persist the results to a
database for later analysis.
