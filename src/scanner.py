"""Market scanning logic for detecting trade setups.

The `scan_market` function iterates over a universe of tickers, calculates
technical indicators using historical and/or streaming data, and matches
conditions defined in the strategy library.  The output is a list of signals
with scores that reflect the quality of the setup.

This starter implementation includes only a skeleton.  You will need to
integrate Polygon’s WebSocket and REST APIs to fetch real‑time bars and
option chain data.  See the README for suggestions on how to extend this.
